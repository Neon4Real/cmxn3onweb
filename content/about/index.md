Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [St Mary's Polytechnic college of engineering,  kerala](http://www.stmaryspolytechnic.in/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2016-2020) with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).

I'm currently working as a developer for **crowdstrike** in the beta  development unit. My responsibilty includes Java/Spring based microservices development & testing. 

I'm also an [Innovation Agent](ur certifiate link here pls neon) fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at Amdocs, India.

I have been awarded as Winner in [Innovation Nugget](ur certifiate link here pls neon), Creativity Jam, [Design Thinking Hackathon](ur certifiate link here pls neon) and Runners-Up in [Project ICE Fair](ur certifiate link here pls neon) by Amdocs.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
